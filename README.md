# FoldComparative 🧬🔍  
**Comparison of AI-Based Protein Structure Prediction Models**

This project is a customized extension of the [AlphaFoldXplore](https://github.com/AngieLCerrutti/AlphaFoldXplore) library, designed to facilitate the analysis and comparison of predicted protein structures generated by tools such as AlphaFold.

---

This work was inspired by and builds upon AlphaFoldXplore, an interface designed to run AlphaFold on Colab and analyze its results locally.

📌  FoldComparative introduces a core function fold_comparative.py developed as part of an academic capstone project, aimed at providing additional tools for structural comparison between sets of models generated by different prediction tools, within the context of a structural benchmarking study.

## 🚀 What's New in This Library?

- Enhances the structural superposition function using only high-confidence regions, based on thresholds defined by the authors of AlphaFold2 (Jumper et al., 2021).

- Integrates functions from AlphaFoldXplore to extract multiple `.pdb` files and apply automated structural superpositions.

- Incorporates the `get_pTMscore` function to extract the pTMscore confidence metric directly from predictions, similarly to pLDDT.

- Computes Euclidean distances between coordinate pairs from `.pdb` files for precise structural analysis.

- Offers distance-based structural metrics such as TM-score and RMSD to compare predicted models.

- Includes tools for 3D visualization of protein structures, either individually or in batches.
